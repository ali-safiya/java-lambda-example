# AWS Lambda "Hello World" Project

This project is an AWS Lambda function that processes an incoming request, greets the user by name, and returns a personalized message. It demonstrates how to use AWS Lambda to handle simple HTTP requests via the AWS API Gateway, making it a great starting point for building serverless applications on AWS.

## Overview

The Lambda function expects a JSON request with a `name` parameter and responds with a greeting message. This is a simple "Hello, World!" application for AWS Lambda, designed to showcase the integration between AWS services and Java code.

## Functionality
Request: The Lambda function expects an incoming JSON object with a name field.

Example request:

{
"name": "Safiya"
}

Response: The Lambda function processes the request and returns a personalized message in a JSON response.

Example response:

{
"message": "Hello Safiya, Welcome to AWS Lambda World!"
}

## Technologies Used
AWS Lambda: A serverless compute service to run the code without provisioning or managing servers.
Java: The Lambda function is written in Java, using the AWS Lambda Java SDK.

Amazon API Gateway: If you're deploying this Lambda as an HTTP endpoint, you'll use API Gateway to trigger the Lambda function.
AWS SDK: Used to interact with AWS services, although for this simple example, the SDK is not used directly.

## Setup and Deployment
Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/ali-safiya/java-lambda-example.git

cd java-lambda-example

Step 2: Build the Project

This project uses Maven as the build tool. To build the project, navigate to the project root and run the following command:

mvn clean package

This will create a JAR file in the target/ directory.

Step 3: Create the Lambda Function on AWS

Log in to the AWS Management Console.

Navigate to the Lambda service.

Click on Create function.

Choose Author from scratch, give it a name like HelloWorldLambda, and select the Java 8+ runtime.

Upload the JAR file generated by Maven (target/your-jar-file.jar).

Set the Handler to com.aws.hello.world.lambda.HelloWorld::handleRequest.

Click on Create function.

Step 4: Test the Lambda Function
You can test your Lambda function directly in the AWS Console:

After creating the Lambda function, click on Test.
Choose Configure test event, and then select Create new test event.
Paste the following JSON as your test input:

{
"name": "Safiya"
}

Click Test.

You should see a response similar to the following:

{
"message": "Hello Safiya, Welcome to AWS Lambda World!"
}

Step 5: Set up API Gateway (Optional)
To expose your Lambda function via HTTP, you can set up Amazon API Gateway:

In the AWS Management Console, go to API Gateway.

Create a new API (REST or HTTP).

Create a new resource and method (e.g., POST).

Set the Integration type to Lambda Function, and select your HelloWorldLambda function.

Deploy the API to a stage.

You will receive a public URL to access your Lambda function via HTTP.

Example Request
Once the Lambda function is set up and exposed via API Gateway, you can send an HTTP request to the endpoint:

Request (POST):

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Safiya"}' https://your-api-id.execute-api.region.amazonaws.com/your-stage/hello

Response:


{
"message": "Hello Safiya, Welcome to AWS Lambda World!"
}

## Conclusion
This project is a simple introduction to AWS Lambda and serverless computing with Java. By deploying this Lambda function, you can see how easy it is to process requests, handle inputs, and return outputsâ€”all without managing servers. You can extend this Lambda function to build more complex, scalable applications using AWS services.
